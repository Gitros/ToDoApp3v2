# 📝 ToDoApp

A personal learning project where I'm building a full-stack **task management app** step by step — from basic CRUD to production-level architecture.

This project is part of my journey to strengthen my skills in **.NET, React, and Clean Architecture**, while learning how to design maintainable and scalable applications.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of **ToDoApp** is to create a simple yet solid **task manager**, developed with professional architectural patterns and modern tools — evolving as I learn new technologies.

Each phase of the project focuses on adding a new layer of complexity and improving the overall structure.
